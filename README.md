  Contact Tracing COVID-19 using Bluetooth Low Energy
  
  This project addresses the topic of determining whether or not there is an obstruction between two devices based on RSSI values of bluetooth low energy beacons from Raspberry Pi 4’s.

  The code uses two artificial neural networks; one to determine whether or not there was a wall between the pi’s and one to determine is unobstructed pi’s were within six feet of each other.

  All code is contained in the notebook named ‘Shi_Manxi_Code.ipynb’   
  Collected data is contained in the zip file named ‘Shi_Manxi_CollectedData.zip’   
  Description of data is contained in the txt file names ‘Shi_Manxi_CollectedDataOverview.txt’
